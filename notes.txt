# Head dump:

- HQ: Head quarter, is the main loop in the Zap runtime. 
It's looping on an MPSC channel, updating the root environement, recording user change, forking environement, etc.

- Extension loading: simple interface for loading an external dynamic library
with a `init` method giving access to the main tokio runtime and an EnvRequester.

- History: When the root environement is mutated (usually when "define" is called),
the mutation's timestamp, symbol associated value can be appened to a mutation log,
allowing the runtime to restart where it was, or to reset the environement to
a certain mutation.

- Async partout?

- Interning all strings used for symbols. Using usize for symbol.

- Functions: Differenciate between native functions and regular functions.
Arguments are stored as a slice of strings.
