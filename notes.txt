# Head dump:

- HQ: Head quarter, is the main loop in the Zap runtime. 
It's looping on an MPSC channel, updating the root environement, recording user change, forking environement, etc.

- Extension loading: simple interface for loading an external dynamic library
with a `init` method giving access to the main tokio runtime and an EnvRequester.

- History: When the root environement is mutated (usually when "define" is called),
the mutation's timestamp, symbol associated value can be appened to a mutation log,
allowing the runtime to restart where it was, or to reset the environement to
a certain mutation.

- Async partout?

- Functions: Differenciate between native functions and regular functions.
Arguments are stored as a slice of .

- Built-in Open Metrics endpoint:
    - Domain count
    - Domain uptime
    - Total evaluation time per domain
    - Total evaluations count per domain
    - Total count of global mutations (define) per domain
    - Total number of keys in the global scope (per domain)
    - Posibility for plugins to send custum metrics through env.
    - Endpoint (address, port) configurable in config file under [metrics]

- zap-integration crate containing all the types (often as re-exports from zap) useful for creating server extensions.
    - Helper function for Tokio handle spawn

- zap-server: cfb for storing the state https://mdsteele.games/rust-cfb/cfb/index.html
